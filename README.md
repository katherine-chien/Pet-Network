A.	Overview
My project will be implementing a "Pet Network" that can used by the owner. It's a database-driven platform that allows pet owners to connect, share experiences, look for help and support each other. The system can combine elements of a social network, such as profiles, posts, and messaging, with pet-specific features, like pet profiles, veterinary info, adoption, and events. The database will probably serve as the foundation for user data, pet data, social interactions, and community activities.

B.	What this project does
It can create a platform for people who owns pet to:
-	Register the pets and owner themselves, also they can share about experience, health info, photos and updates
-	Discover local pet events or petsitter
-	Access resources like vets, traning services, and adoption centers
-	Connect with other pet owners through groups, messaging, and events (one-to-one, one-to-more, and more-to-one).

C.	Why is it needed
Nowadays, more and more people choose to have pets instead of children, and existing platforms like Facebook or Instagram are too general for the unique needs of pet communities. Rover’s features are less comprehensive. Therefore, it's a need to make a platform that can let pet owners got a dedicated, organized way that can connect socially while also accessing trusted resources about pet care.

D.	What Problem does it solve
There are three main problems that can be solve:
First, fragmented pet communities, currently, pet owners use scattered forums or general social media. The project consolidates pet related networking.
Second, access to pet care information. It can provides structured info on veterinary services, adoption opportunities, and training programs.
Third, the owners can find supports, ask questions, and share tips with individuals.

E.	Who does this benefit
5 types of people could have benefit. First, pet owners, the main beneficiaries who use the platform socially and informationally.
Second, veterinarians and trainers. They can gain visibility and interact with clients. Third, adoption centers, they can share pets available for adoption. Also, I think the most database will be used. Forth, event organizers, they could promote local pet-friendly events. Last but not least, pet product sellers and service providers could receive more clients because their target costumer are using the platform.
